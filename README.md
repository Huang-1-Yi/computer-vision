# Overview

Welcome to the YOLOv10 repository! This project aims to implement and fine-tune the state-of-the-art object detection model, YOLOv10, for various applications. The repository provides a detailed guide on installing, using, and contributing to this project.

# Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tapanBabbar9/yolov10.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: The `requirements.txt` file includes necessary packages such as OpenCV, NumPy, and scikit-image.

# Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Run the Jupyter notebook to explore the code and visualize the results:
```bash
jupyter notebook yolov10.ipynb
```
2. Train a YOLOv10 model using the provided dataset (e.g., COCO):
```python
python train.py --data-path /path/to/your/dataset
```
3. Use the pre-trained models for object detection:
```python
python detect.py --model yolov10.h5 --image-path /path/to/image
```
4. Visualize the detected objects using OpenCV:
```python
python visualize.py --detections yolov10_output.txt
```
