Here is a detailed README file for the project:

**Overview**
=============

This repository contains the implementation of YOLOv10 (You Only Look Once v10), a real-time object detection system that detects objects in images and videos. The model is trained on the COCO dataset and can detect objects with high accuracy.

**Installation**
===============

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/tapanBabbar9/yolov10.git`
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (assuming you have Python and pip installed)
3. Install the necessary libraries for training the model:
	* OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
	* NumPy: `pip install numpy`
4. Install the Jupyter Notebook library if you want to run the notebooks:
	* Jupyter: `pip install jupyter`

**Usage**
==========

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Download the pre-trained model weights from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing) and save them in the `weights` folder.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `yolov10_notebook.ipynb` to test the model on sample images or videos.
3. Use the `detect.py` script to detect objects in your own images or videos:
	* Run `python detect.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg`
	* Run `python detect.py --video_path /path/to/video.mp4`

**Contribution Guidelines**
==========================
