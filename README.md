Here is a detailed README file for the project:

**Overview**
---------
The `yolov10` project is an implementation of You Only Look Once (YOLO) v10, a popular object detection algorithm. This project provides a Jupyter Notebook-based interface to train and evaluate YOLOv10 models on custom datasets.

**Installation**
---------------

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/tapanBabbar9/yolov10.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
	* `pip install cv2 ultralytics`

**Usage**
----------

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in the cloned repository: `jupyter notebook`
2. Run the `object_detect.ipynb` notebook .
3. Adjust the hyperparameters and experiment with different configurations to achieve optimal results.

**Contribution Guidelines**
---------------------------

1. Fork this repository: `git fork https://github.com/tapanBabbar9/yolov10.git`
2. Clone your forked repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/yolov10.git`
3. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b my-feature`
4. Make changes and commit them: `git add . && git commit -m "Added features XYZ"`
5. Push your changes to the remote repository: `git push origin my-feature`
6. Open a pull request: `git pull-request` (on GitHub)
